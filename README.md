# Biodatabase_Assembly
From now, we are managing to build a protein properties database for deep learning and feature analysis. It has been wildly accepted that the quantity and quality of database are crucial to the performance of deep learning or other machine learning methods. But up to now, it is tough to obtain a proper and open resources database in order to applying machine learning technology such as Penn Tree Bank corpus serving for NLP. 
This package aims to assemble the varity of biological database for public usage, and rebuild a functional and easy-to-use protein properties database. Finally, we will establish the database on Mariadb and also provide online user download interface.
